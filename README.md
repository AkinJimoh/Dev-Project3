# Kubernetes Helm Problem
## Background
This is a sample Helm deployment. It deploys a nginx web server.
Assume that there is nginx ingress in place. DNS is outside of scope

## Task
This task should take less than 30 minutes
  1) You are to modify this deployment so it has a simple "Hello World" html web page
  2) The body of the web page should contain some custom text that comes from a helm variable / value
  3) This README should be updated giving instructions on the command line that should be used.

## Optional
  Any corrections that this chart should have.
